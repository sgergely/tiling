# Ride every tile
Collecting tiles on Veloviewers application based on your Strava activities.
Lot of fun if you got bored on your daily commute, training rides or have a healthy race with your cycling buddies to discover new stuff.

[There's an intro in Hungarian available.](csempezes.pdf)

Tiles can be found here:
`https://veloviewer.com/athlete/<strava user id>/activities`

## Race results:
Due to GDPR concerns the following sites are no longer showing the results. However on Veloviewer a high level overview can be checked under Leaderboards.

It is said that it is going to be updated monthly but that not always happens: https://rideeverytile.com/tiles/leaderboard_national#HungaryLeaderboardHeader

Refreshed more often than the one above: https://rakietowa.org/maxsquare/

## During the ride:
* 'EveryTile' app for Garmin devices, shows if you are already in a tile: https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/e53331b6-55db-475a-99e9-3f567327e7ce
* 'Geoládák' app for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/hu/app/geoládák/id1214718958?l=hu) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tamaspetro.geocachinghu&hl=en&gl=US) devices. Supports various map layers (including mapy.cz), offline maps, routing, kml/gpx import, etc. Great to use together with missing tiles KML.
