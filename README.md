Lot of fun if you got bored on your daily commute, training rides or have a healthy race with your cycling buddies to discover new stuff.

## Planning:
* https://en.mapy.cz/ has the most up-to-date gravel roads (at least in Hungary), has an app as well
* missing tiles in KML format from Veloviewer Summary page to this (available as an iOS app as well) app: https://geoladak.tamaspetro.com/tracks
* Strava route planner Chrome extensions:
  * Veloviewer chrome extension with Strava route planner. With that enabled you can see the tiles in the Strava route planner https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/veloviewer-strava-plugin/kdgpnlmocdpeckamipkkdblnfcpkgbno?hl=en
  * Change the map in the strava route planner for example to mapy.cz map: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strava-map-switcher/djcheclpmmkcdkjcenfamalobdenmici/related?hl=en
* https://nakarte.me is the google streetview of gravel roads
* Some random dude collecting rideable gravel (mtb) routes: https://navitrails.com/mtbtracks/

## During the ride:
* 'EveryTile' app for Garmin devices, shows if you are already in a tile: https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/e53331b6-55db-475a-99e9-3f567327e7ce
* 'Geol치d치k' app for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/hu/app/geol치d치k/id1214718958?l=hu) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tamaspetro.geocachinghu&hl=en&gl=US) devices. Supports various map layers (including mapy.cz), offline maps, routing, kml/gpx import, etc. Great to use together with missing tiles KML.
